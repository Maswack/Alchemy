# Loot Tables

Loot tables allow you to change the loot of Minecraft, or add new loot tables. This folder will create a new loot table that could be used in a `/summon` or `/setblock` command. Check out the `minecraft` namespace if you want to override a vanilla loot table - as this will use a different method.

Personally, especially if you are new or don't understand JSON or how Minecraft uses it (if this makes no sense to you, just keep reading), [using Misode's generators](https://misode.github.io). I have used that for this tutorial (although I could do it on my own probably :P).
